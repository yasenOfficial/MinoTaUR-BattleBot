# Introduction
This battle-ready machine is constructed from durable stainless steel, powered by repurposed hoverboard motors, and controlled by an Arduino-based system and a 2.4 GHz receiver . It has proven its worth on the BattleBots arena and is ready for more action.

# Features
Stainless Steel Build: The BattleBot is constructed from high-quality stainless steel, providing exceptional durability, resistance to damage during combat and making it 25 kilograms.

Hoverboard Motors: The bot is driven by motors salvaged from a disassembled hoverboard, delivering powerful and agile movement on the battlefield. These Motors can carry about 100 kilograms! When the robot is started and the speed is at max the front part of the battlebot lifts up about 6 degrees.

Arduino Control: An Arduino-based control system manages the BattleBot's weapon control. It reads the signals from the 2.4GHz receiver and based on the timing of the impulses decides whether to turn on the fast spinning metal blade.

High-Speed Spinning Blade: The BattleBot is equipped with a high-speed spinning blade that can cause significant damage to opponents. The motor that spins this blade is from a disassembled drill. 

2.4GHz Receiver: The bot communicates with its operator using a 2.4GHz receiver, ensuring reliable control during intense battles.

Hoverboard motherboard: We salvaged the motherboard from the hoverboard and reflashed its firmware ( that way the motors can go faster only by changing the software ). The new software also allows us to connect the 2.4 Ghz receiver directly to the motherboard.

Champion of TUES BattleBots 2023: This BattleBot has already proven its mettle by winning the prestigious TUES BattleBots competition in 2023.
