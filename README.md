# Introduction
This battle-ready machine is constructed from durable stainless steel, powered by repurposed hoverboard motors, and controlled by an Arduino-based system and a 2.4 GHz receiver . It has proven its worth on the BattleBots arena and is ready for more action.

# Features
Stainless Steel Build: The BattleBot is constructed from high-quality stainless steel, providing exceptional durability, resistance to damage during combat and making it 25 kilograms.

Hoverboard Motors: The bot is driven by motors salvaged from a disassembled hoverboard, delivering powerful and agile movement on the battlefield.

Arduino Control: An Arduino-based control system manages the BattleBot's weapon control.

High-Speed Spinning Blade: The BattleBot is equipped with a high-speed spinning blade that can cause significant damage to opponents.

2.4GHz Receiver: The bot communicates with its operator using a 2.4GHz receiver, ensuring reliable control during intense battles.

Hoverboard motherboard: We salvaged the motherboard from the hoverboard and reflashed its firmware ( that way the motors can go faster only by changing the software ).

Champion of TUES BattleBots 2023: This BattleBot has already proven its mettle by winning the prestigious TUES BattleBots competition in 2023.
